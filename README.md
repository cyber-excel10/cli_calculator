# Title of Project:CLI Calculator.

*Welcome to Excel2024 Calculator! This is a simple command-line calculator written in Rust that can perform a variety of mathematical operations. Whether you're looking to do basic arithmetic or more advanced operations like trigonometry and logarithms, this calculator can help.
The features of this calculator are:

*It performs basic mathematical operations such as:
.Addition (+)
.Subtraction (-)
.Multiplication (*)
.Division (/)
.Exponentiation (^)

*It also performs trigonometric operations (in degrees) such as:
.Sine (sin)
.Cosine (cos)
.Tangent (tan)
.Compute the square root of a number (square_root)
.Calculate logarithms (log base 10)


*How to Use the calculator
Start the Calculator: After running the program, you'll see the following prompt:Hello, Welcome And Thanks For Choosing Excel2024 Calculator! We Perform Mathematical Operation.
You Can Input Your Calculations Or If You Want To Quit You Can Input 'Exit' To Close The Page.

*I also tried to handle errors such as:
1.Invalid Format: If the input doesn't follow the correct format, you'll see an error like:Invalid Format! Please Consider Using: <number> <operator> <number>.
2.Unsupported Operators: If you use an operator that isn't supported, you'll see:Unsupported Operator: <operator>.
3.Division by Zero: Attempting to divide by zero results in or you will get:Cannot Be Divided By Zero!
4.Invalid Numeric Input: If an alphabetical value is entered where a number is expected, you'll see:Please Consider Inputting A Numeric Value.
5.Square Root of a Negative Number: Attempting to take the square root of a negative number will result in:Computing A Negative Number Square Root Is Not Accepted!!!
6.Logarithm of Non-Positive Numbers: Trying to take the logarithm of a zero or negative number will result in:Please Consider Removing Negative Value When Dealing With Logarithm.

*If in case you want to run or install this cli calculator,please follow the steps below:
.Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli_calculator.git
.Then to navigate to the project directory you will input: cd cli_calculator
.To run the project after navigating to the project directory you will input:cargo run

*To run this make sure you have Rust installed.If not, you can install it from the official Rust website: rust-lang.org.
*And also have a code editor(any) or make use of your terminal to run the project.

*Thank you for trying out my project! If you encounter any issues, have questions, or would like to provide feedback, feel free to contact me by email.
